 <p>Amid intense jockeying for power and allegations of horse-trading, Karnataka Governor Vajubhai Vala on May 16 invited the BJP’s B.S. Yeddyurappa to form the government in the State, prompting the Congress to move the Supreme Court. The party has urged Chief Justice Dipak Misra to hold an urgent hearing.</p>,
 <p>Earlier in the day, the Janata Dal (Secular)-Congress combine and the BJP have submitted the list of MLAs supporting them. The JD(S) and the BJP have also completed the process of electing the leaders of their respective Legislature Parties.</p>,
 <p>The day has also seen the JD(S) accusing the BJP of indulging in horse-trading, which the latter dismissed as imagination.</p>,
 <p>Karnataka returned as hung Assembly on May 15 with the BJP scoring 104 seats, Congress 78 and the JD(S) 37. In a dramatic turn of events, the Congress has offered support to the JD(S), which was duly accepted by party leader H.D. Kumaraswamy.</p>,
 <p>The Secretary-General of the Supreme Court along with other senior registrars have reached the residence of the Chief Justice apparently to inform him about the Congress- JD(S) petition seeking an urgent hearing on the issue.</p>,
 <p>Security has been beefed up tonight and a strong posse of policemen deployed on the way leading to the 5, Krishna Menon Marg residence of CJI Dipak Misra.</p>,
 <p>As a midnight political drama was played out, traffic was diverted and barricades were placed at various places on the Krishna Menon Marg, even as journalists rushed to the CJI’s residence in anticipation that advocates for the Congress party will mention the petition for urgent hearing in the case tonight itself.</p>,
 <p>One of the policemen said they were only informed that some VIP movements are likely to take place and therefore, security arrangements have been made. Security was also stepped up around the Supreme Court premises where the lawyers for the Congress met the registrar.</p>,
 <p>Only one gate, i.e. Gate No E, was opened for the lawyers and court staff. The journalists were kept out.</p>,
 <p>A large number of policemen and PCR vans were seen stationed there.</p>,
 <p>Abhishek Manu Singhvi is leading the Congress-JD(S) challenge against the Karnataka Governor’s decision. He tweets: “Since swearing in now announced for 9 am on 17/5/18, in a 9 pm invite by Governor today to (Mr. Yeddyurappa) to form Govt, urgency to seek listing in Supreme Court tonight is self-validating. If Supreme Court registry accepts petitioners’ request on basis of petition settled by me and filed tonight, I will appear and argue tonight.”</p>,
 <p>Mr. Kumaraswamy has slammed the Governor’s decision and accused the Narendra Modi government of misusing Constitutional institutions. “We will not let it go easily...”, a furious Mr. Kumaraswamy told reporters shortly after the Governor wrote to Mr. Yeddyurappa. </p>,
 <p>Mr. Kumaraswamy said the Governor should have given three or four days time for Mr. Yeddyurappa to prove his majority. “He (Mr. Yeddyurappa) has no majority,” Mr. Kumaraswamy said.</p>,
 <p>“It will be a repeat of 2008...they will loot the State,” he said, referring to the then BJP rule. Asked about the next step, he said, “Wait and see.”</p>,
 <p>Congress approached Supreme Court registrar late on Wednesday evening seeking urgent relief, say sources. Senior lawyer Abhishek Manu Singhvi will move a petition on Thursday morning.</p>,
 <p>Congress has urged Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra to hold an urgent hearing tonight itself.</p>,
 <p>Black letter day for the Constitution, says Congress reacting to the development. “By trashing the Constitution and murdering democracy, tomorrow an illegitimate government will take oath, says partry spokesman Randeep Surjewala.  </p>,
 <p>“Letter of Governor clearly shows that even he doesn't believe that BJP has the numbers.”</p>,
 <p>Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said the Governor had the leeway to exercise his discretion as per the bounds of the Constitution. "Both Sarkaria and M M Punchi commission were clear on the order in which parties were to be invited to form the government", Mr. Prasad said.</p>,
 <p>"Number one, the biggest pre-poll alliance, secondly the single largest party staking a claim, thirdly a post poll alliance,” the Law Minister said.</p>,
 <p>“Congress is raising a protest because they haven’t been able to digest the loss in Karnataka”, Mr. Prasad said.</p>,
 <p>“Congress CM fought from two seats, he lost one seat, barely managed to win the other, and was projected as a dynamic CM who brought in the golden age in Karnataka. Sixteen of his Ministers also lost. What is the signal about the mandate here?</p>,
 <p>“I ask Rahul and Sonia Gandhi who harp on their legacy, in 1989 the Congress had the largest number of seats but his father Rajiv Gandhi declared that the mandate was against him and was for V.P. Singh and others. Is Rahul Gandhi unaware of the democratic tradition within his own family?”</p>,
 <p>BJP leader Muralidhar Rao says that the Governor has invited Mr. Yeddyurappa to form the government. He will take oath at 9 a.m. tomorrow. Just now, Governor’s office has given us the letter, inviting Mr. Yeddyurappa to take oath and form the government.  I welcome the invitation."</p>,
 <p>Mr. Rao says: “BJP has always followed core democratic principles. There is well laid out procedure... when clear majority is not there... in such a situation, when there is no pre-poll alliance, according to the Constitution and Supreme Court observation in S.R. Bommai case, the single largest party should be called and be given an opportunity to form government.”</p>,
 <p>“BJP is the single largest party. Of 222 seats, BJP has won 104 seats. The other two parties had fought against each other. They fought bitterly. Criticised each other. Personalised attacks were also other. All are in public domain. The result is complete rejection of Siddaramaiah government,” says Mr. Rao. "We will prove majority on the floor of the house. While giving the invitation, the Governor has said floor test should be held within 15 days.”</p>,

 <p>Congress leaders P. Chidamabaram, Kapil Sibal, Vivek Tankha and Randeep Surjewala are giving a press conference on the Karnataka developments.</p>,
 <p>“As we are doing this press conference, we heard the Governor may have invited Yeddyuruppa, but none has been able to confirm it. We are proceeding on the basis that the Governor has not acted,” Mr. Chidambaram says.</p>,
 <p>“What has stopped the Governor from inviting H.D. Kumaraswamy, leader of the alliance that commands the majority of the Assembly?</p>,
 <p>“The only way to uphold the Constitution is to invite the Congress-JD(S) alliance,” he says.</p>,
 <p>Mr. Sibal says “Man ki Baat” has now become “Dhan Ki baat”.</p>,
 <p>Asked about moving court or approaching the President, Mr. Sibal says, “We have the options open, and will decide which one to take.”</p>,
 <p>Mr. Chidamabaram says there are many options between now and tomorrow morning but can’t comment on which option to take without confirmation from the Raj Bhavan. “If the Governor does not invite Kumaraswamy, then he is encouraging horse-trading.”</p>,
 <p>Congress spokesman Randeep Surjewala says Congress and JD(S) are ready to parade all their 117 MLAs.</p>,
 <p>Mr. Chidamabaram says, “We still hope that the Governor will follow the only path available to him, the Constitutional path.”</p>,

 <p>The lone Bahujan Samaj Party MLA N. Mahesh, who has been elected from Kollegal constituency in Chamarajanagar district, has claimed that some BJP office-bearers got in touch with him seeking support to form government. "However, I asked them to get in touch with our national leader Mayawati. I am firmly with JD(S)," he said. The BSP went to polls in alliance with the JD(S). It contested in 20 seats and won in one.</p>,
 <p>Members of the Congress and JD(S) met the Governor of Karnataka at around 5 p.m. on Wednesday. KPCC President G. Parameshwara, who met the Governor along with JD(S) chief H. D. Kumaraswamy, said letters with signature of 117 MLAs were submitted to the Governor.</p>,

 <p><em>PTI adds:</em></p>,
 <p>Mr. Kumaraswamy said the Governor told the delegation that after consulting legal experts on the Supreme Court judgments, he would “come to a decision and inform us about it.” Next step has to be decided by the Governor, he added.</p>,
 <p>“Governor said he will decide about considering our claim in accordance with the Constitution. I hope that he will abide by the Constitution and give his direction,” he said.</p>,
 <p>Mr. Parameshwara said a copy of the resolution passed at the Congress Legislature Party was submitted to the Governor.</p>,
 <p>The Governor said he would act in accordance with the law, based on apex court judgments and as per the constitution while also looking at precedents followed earlier in states like Goa, Mizoram, Nagaland and Manipur, he said.</p>,
 <p>Election Commission sources say that the gazette notification on the conclusion of poll process is likely to be submitted to the Governor's office in a couple of hours. The Governor is expected to take a call on inviting which group to form government after receiving the notification.</p>,

 <p>In a statement, the Left party alleged that the constitutional office of the Governor was being misused in the southern state.</p>,
 <p>“The politburo of the CPI(M) strongly opposes the time given to the BJP to indulge in naked horse-trading and the use of money power to muster a majority in the Karnataka Assembly.</p>,
 <p>Mr. Siddaramaiah has accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of encouraging horse-trading to lure Congress and JD(S) legislators to their party for forming the government.</p>,
 <p>“Modi and Shah are supporting BJP leaders in horse-trading to poach legislators of our party and the Janata Dal (Secular) to prevent us from forming the next government in the state,” <strong>IANS</strong> quoted Mr. Siddaramaiah as saying in Bengaluru.</p>,
 <p>Asserting that the party would not allow the BJP to form a government in the state at any cost, Mr. Siddaramaiah said none of the Congress legislators were missing or likely to defect to the BJP. “We have a plan to safeguard our MLAs, who are together and will not join the BJP, which has 8 less seats for the 112-halfway mark and prove majority,” Mr. Siddaramaiah said.</p>,
 <p>“We have extended our support to the JD(S) to form the new government, with its State leader H.D. Kumaraswamy as Chief Minister. As we have the numbers (118), Governor Vajubhai R. Vala should call our alliance first than the BJP, which does not have the required numbers,” Mr. Siddaramaiah pointed out.</p>,
 <p>The Congress and the JD(S) will parade their MLAs before the Governor at 5 p.m. JD(S) leader H.D. Kumaraswamy has left the Shangri-La Hotel for the Raj Bhavan. A bus has been kept ready near the KPCC office to take the MLAs to Raj Bhavan.</p>,
 <p>JD(S) MLAs have already reached the Raj Bhavan for their “parade” before <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/elections/karnataka-2018/governor-is-an-old-bjp-hand/article23896338.ece" title="Governor is an old BJP hand">Governor Vajubhai Vala</a>. The Congress legislators are expected to reach the Raj Bhavan soon.</p>,
 <p>Union Mininister Prakash Javadekar dismissed Mr. Kumaraswamy’s charge that BJP was offering ₹100 crore to lure its MLAs, calling it “imaginary.”</p>,
 <p>Meanwhile, outgoing Chief Minister Siddaramaiah accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of encouraging horse-trading. “We have 117 MLAs. Governor has to give the opportunity to us (JD(S)-Congress combine) to form the government,” he said.</p>,

 </p>,
 <p>Mr. Kumaraswamy accused the BJP of offering ₹100 crore to some of its party members.</p>,
 <p>Speaking at the Janata Dal Legislative Party meeting, Mr. Kumaraswamy warned the BJP that if it tried ‘Operation Lotus’ once more it would backfire.</p>,
 <p>“If the BJP indulges in horse trading I will not sit quiet. I am not a Sanyasi to keep quiet and watch the proceedings,” he said. “I would like to tell the Governor that he should not allow horse trading.”</p>,
 <p>He said the Congress-JD(S) combine had a “clear majority” with the support of 116 MLAs.</p>,
 <p>“Without the numbers, how can they (BJP) form the government?” he asked.</p>,
 <p>Mr. Kumaraswamy downplayed the criticism by the Congress in the run-up to the polls. “It is natural in politics. Wasn’t Yeddyurappa once a bitter critic of the BJP... and now its CM candidate?”</p>,

 <p>Until Tuesday morning, Mr. Kumaraswamy, State president of the JD(S), was identified as the “kingmaker”, who would ally with either national party in case of an unclear verdict in the elections. By evening, with a fractured mandate, he was transformed to become a “possible king” in a day of swift developments.</p>,
